-- 20260907000011_lng_cash_safe_position_v2.sql
--
-- lng_cash_safe_position, second edition. Same single source of truth
-- for "what should be in the safe right now" (see 20260708000003 for
-- the reasoning), extended so the count sheet can do its own detective
-- work when the physical count disagrees with the recorded figure.
--
-- What changed:
--
--   1. p_period_end. The count sheet snapshots a count with an explicit
--      period_end. Until now the CLIENT recomputed expected_pence for
--      that window with its own copy of the maths (and slightly
--      different boundary rules: >= vs >). Two implementations of one
--      number is how two devices end up disagreeing. Now the client
--      asks this function for the figure at exactly period_end and
--      stores what it is told. One computation, everywhere.
--
--   2. Who took each payment. Every payment line now carries the staff
--      member who took it (taken_by name parts). When a count is short
--      or over, "who handled the cash" is the first question anyone
--      asks; the previous payload could not answer it.
--
--   3. Clues (p_include_clues). The evidence a reconciler needs to
--      explain a difference, all from the same window and location:
--        * other_payments  — every NON-cash payment in the window. A
--                            surplus that exactly matches a card payment
--                            almost always means a patient paid cash but
--                            the payment was logged as card.
--        * open_balances   — visits opened in the window that still owe
--                            money. A surplus matching one of these is
--                            cash that was taken but never logged.
--        * last_signed_count now includes expected_pence and
--          variance_pence, so a carried-over difference from the
--          previous count is visible rather than rediscovered.
--      The client runs the matching (exact, pairs, triples, pence
--      analysis) on this data; the server just guarantees the data is
--      the same for every caller.
--
-- Signature change drops the old (uuid) overload so PostgREST never has
-- to choose between two candidates when the client passes no arguments.
